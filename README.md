prestashopToDolibarr
====================

A Prestashop module to synchronise clients, products and invoices to Dolibarr.
Dolibarr API is used, so you can have a prestashop and a dolibarr intalled on a different server.

To make it work you need :
* PrestaShop 1.5.x and 1.6.x
* Dolibarr >= 3.6.3 (not release yet). This is because prior version contains bugs that prevent the module from working properly.


You need to active Dolibarr webservice to allow prestashop to communicate with your dolibarr instance.

Originally based on deprecated "all4doli" module by Presta 2 Doli.
